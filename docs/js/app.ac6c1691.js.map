href=\"https://www.streetsmarts.life/\">StreetSmarts</a> is a web-based application which aids management of business\n                  operations for people who rent their cars through online platforms like <a href=\"https://turo.com/\">Turo</a>.\n                </p>\n                <p>The Fleet Tracker would allow users an easy way to see all of their cars and if they were available</p>\n                <p>The StreetSmarts platform uses Material UI as their component library and as such, my designs needed to utilize the\n                  components of Material UI as well.\n                </p>\n                </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n\n          </div>\n          <div id='ss-ft-research' class=\"opac-0\" :class=\"{ 'animated fadeInUp': scrollY > 1020 || isApplied('ss-ft-research') }\">\n\n            <h3><strong>User Research</strong></h3>\n            <p>For user research, I interviewed a super user of the platform as well as a mid level user. Since two interviews would not\n              be quite enough, I also pulled some feedback from the StreetSmarts Facebook group that was provided when the user base was\n              asked which feature they'd like to see implemented first.\n            </p>\n            <p>The interviews uncovered a bit more wants for the Fleet Tracker feature than originally estimated. Not only did users\n              want to be able to see cars that were available, they also wanted to be able to see accurate information about those rentals.\n              Upon looking at Turo, their tracker was based on a single car and you'd have to go into another car to see when that car was\n              available. The Turo platform only had dates and did not provide the users with information on times the car was available\n              booked. It seemed that had to be guessed and as such the user base wanted to be able to see the times their cars were\n              available as well.\n            </p>\n            <p>The users wanted to stick with the idea of a calendar for the tracker but were not particular if it was a month calendar\n              view or a week view. In the same line of thought, the users were not particular to wether the calendar was text based or\n              more visual.\n            </p>\n            <p>The last big thing that came up during the interviews was that the users were having problems where they would be on the\n              phone with a renter and the renter would book the wrong car. Since the interaction was being handled over the phone, the\n              user would not be able to direct the renter to the correct car in Turo and as such the renter would usually book the wrong\n              vehicle. Because of this, the user base needed a way to share the vehicle booking with their renter after the call or during\n              the call.\n            </p>\n          </div>\n\n          <div id='ss-ft-1' class=\"opac-0\" :class=\"{ 'animated fadeInUp': scrollY > 1458 || isApplied('ss-ft-1') }\">\n\n            <div class=\"row\">\n              <div class='col-md-7'>\n                <img class=\"image-size\" src=\"/img/streetsmarts/Fleet_Tracker_v1_Month.png\" />\n                <img class=\"image-size\" src=\"/img/streetsmarts/Fleet_Tracker_v1_Week.png\" />\n              </div>\n              <div class='col-md-5'>\n                <h3><strong>Initial Wireframes</strong></h3>\n                <p>Based on the user interviews; these were the inital wireframes. Since the users had no preference to a month calendar or a\n                  week calendar, I designed both to see how they'd look.\n                </p>\n              </div>\n            </div>\n          </div>\n\n          <div id='ss-ft-2' class=\"opac-0\" :class=\"{ 'animated fadeInUp': scrollY > 2148 || isApplied('ss-ft-2') }\">\n\n            <div class=\"row\">\n              <div class='col-md-5'>\n                <h3><strong>Round 2 Wireframes</strong></h3>\n\n                <p>I conducted some breif usability tests on the inital wireframes with the users I interviewed and found that they wanted\n                  to be able to see their booked cars in some cases as well. They also had no preference to either calendar view either and\n                  so I decided to keep both as there was positive feedback for both.

It allows the user to pan around the\n              map and zoom in and zoom out. My original idea was to ax that as I was going to have other elements that could be positioned\n              around the page and I didn’t want the user to feel like everything was overlapping too much. However, table top players like\n              their large maps. So I axed my own idea and changed it so that user could resize their map, as long as it wasn’t too small,\n              and allow them to collapse and expand other widgets to give them optimal viewing space.\n            </p>\n            <p>Next important feedback: “The bar at the top of the game board screen isn’t clear that it means a new window will be opened\n              up.

Each game would have their own settings based on the user’s preference for that game’s play style. Maybe\n              in one game the user isn’t using video at all and as such wouldn’t even need the video widget anymore. This also brought to\n              light, in pairing with the previous feedback, that the Data Library widget was going to suffer if left on the game board.\n              There was going to be too much information to be displayed in a widget. So I changed the idea of new window, gave the user a\n              dropdown bar that allows them to open a new window with the data library, change their settings and exit the game board.\n              Exiting the game board would return the user to their Games page instead of closing the application completely.\n            </p>\n          </div>\n\n          <div id='v-6' class=\"opac-0\" :class=\"{ 'animated fadeInUp': scrollY > 5362 || isApplied('v-6') }\">\n            <h3><strong>Invision Prototype</strong></h3>\n            <a href=\"https://projects.invisionapp.com/share/4GGQHVG2BK7#/screens/289856614_Home_Page\" target=\"_blank\">\n            <img src=\"/img/invisionapp.png\" id=\"invision\" />\n            </a>\n            <h3><strong>Technical Demo</strong></h3>\n            <p>The Game Board page of Venture.ng features widgets that can be moved, resized, collpased and expanded so I wanted to show\n              just exactly how that would work.

A guided Character\n                Sheet creation would chop off some time when creating a character.\n              </li>\n              <li>Ruleset Based Data Library. Players are bad at even obtaining player guide books. Not all information for each ruleset is avaliable online either. A centralized Data Library would give players without access to the books, the information they need.</li>\n              <li>Friends. Not everyone has friends or habitually checks the looking for group reddit and these people also need a way to\n                play tabletop (even with strangers).

The requirements changed almost every meeting. One of the core requirements were that the users needed a way to indicate that they had \"okay'd\" a line item in an account. The reason for this was because sometimes an account could have hundreds upon hundreds of line items and a user may not finish reviewing an account that day. When they came back to the account they needed to know that they were already part way done and didn't have to start over.</p>\n                <p>With these designs I provided a couple different ways to use the statusing in order to find accounts that hadn't been reviewed yet. A search for the table was introduced so that any accounts outside of the search parameters would not be shown on the table. Another way to allow the user to check over statuses quickly was allowing the ability to click on the headers and change the ordering of the table. This way, say for example, the user wanted to only have their not completed accounts at the top, they could click the header and change the ordering.</p>\n              </div>\n              <div class='col-md-7'>\n                <img class=\"image-size\" src=\"/img/FidelityStuff/HoldingPage/HoldingPageExample1.png\" />\n                <img class=\"image-size\" src=\"/img/FidelityStuff/HoldingPage/HoldingPageExample2.png\" />\n                <img class=\"image-size\" src=\"/img/FidelityStuff/HoldingPage/HoldingPageExample3Comment.png\" />\n              </div>\n            </div>\n            <div class='row'>\n                <div class='col-md-12'>\n                     <p>The only other two core requirements were the ability to comment on a line item and the ability to edit a line item in line. A lot of 17a6 was manual work and the users had to correct line items if they did not match up to the statements that were provided. At this point the requirement of editing inline had not been completely solidified. It still needed to be decided if the user could edit the whole line item or just part of it.</p>\n                    <p>Users prefered the third design. The only issue with it was that there were a lot of icons at the end of a row. We needed to determine a way to keep the functionality of the icons but remove some of them.</p>\n                </div>\n                </div>\n          </div>\n\n          <div id='fi-17-final' class=\"opac-0\" :class=\"{ 'animated fadeInUp': scrollY > 3079 || isApplied('fi-17-final') }\">\n\n            <div class=\"row\">\n              <div class='col-md-7'>\n                <img class=\"image-size\" src=\"/img/FidelityStuff/HoldingPage/HoldingPageEditedReviewed.png\" />\n                <img class=\"image-size\" src=\"/img/FidelityStuff/HoldingPage/HoldingPageEdit.png\" />\n              </div>\n              <div class='col-md-5'>\n                <h3><strong>Final Designs</strong></h3>\n                <p>An additional requirement was added on at this point.

This requirement would be reconsidered later.</p>\n                <p>I worked with the development team to add in functionality without the need for icons. We were able to decide that the editing of a line item could be done by double clicking on one of the columns within the line item. This would allow the user to edit the information they had the permissions to change.</p>\n                <p>At the end of the two weeks, unfortunately, the project had to be put on hold because requirements were changing too often. </p>\n                \n              </div>\n              <div class='row'>\n                <div class='col-md-12'>\n                <h3><strong>What I Learned</strong></h3>\n                <p>\n                <ul>\n                  <li>Technology restrictions need to be confrimed early.
