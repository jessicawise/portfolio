platform as well as a mid level user. Since two interviews would not\n              be quite enough, I also pulled some feedback from the StreetSmarts Facebook group that was provided when the user base was\n              asked which feature they'd like to see implemented first.\n            </p>\n            <p>The interviews uncovered a bit more wants for the Fleet Tracker feature than originally estimated.

A lot of the platform was created without a UX Designer involved and so it was weighed down\n                  by things essentially stacked on top of each other. For users who used the platform since the beginning,\n                  this was no problem.

This would give some hesitant users a peek into what StreetSmarts could do\n                  without fully committing to it right away. Originally, the tolls page was just a list of tolls that renters\n                  would go through and then the user would either pay themselves or add to the bill of the renter. The list\n                  didn't say if the toll had been processed or if it couldn't be matched to a reservation or anything.\n                </p>\n                <p>The exploration needed to better section out the list of tolls into categories to help users easily tell\n                  if anything needed to be done to the toll or if they wanted to do anything. We wanted to automatically assign\n                  tolls to a reservation but we also wanted to allow users to cancel that toll if they didn't wnat to pass it on\n                  to their renter.

One\n                  thing I learned while working with StreetSmarts is that their users know their reservations like the back of their\n                  hands. They would probably not need a way to search all reservations for the correct one to place the toll on. However,\n                  just to be on the cautious side I suggested keeping the car the toll was sent to as a column. This would help prevent some\n                  user error. After that, the user would just need to enter the name of the renter or the reservation number that the toll\n                  needed to be assigned to.

Users who\n                  had Toll accounts only would be prompted to upgrade to a full StreetSmarts account to access Automated Messaging.

Currently in the\n                wireframes there is no way to tell what was done to a toll. This would mean the user wouldn't know if they\n                had passed on the charge to the user unless they looked at the reservation history of if they paid the toll\n                themselves.\n              </li>\n              <li>Allowing execution or cancelation on the Unassigned category.

With the\n                  exploration, there are not many iterations of designs because I was only taking what was there and shifting\n                  it around or trying out new ways of showing the same information.

Some examples\n                  would be a confirmation message after a car was rented or a thank you message after the rental was returned.\n                </p>\n              </div>\n            </div>\n          </div>\n\n          <div id='ss-m-1' class=\"opac-0\" :class=\"{ 'animated fadeInUp': scrollY > 1358 || isApplied('ss-m-1') }\">\n\n            <div class=\"row\">\n              <div class='col-md-5'>\n                <h3><strong>How It Started..</strong></h3>\n                <p>The current layout for the automated messages seemed okay at first glance. However, it quickly became\n                  clear that that was wrong. Immidiately, the problem is that a user could see that the messages were\n                  not enabled by the red message strike out icon. However, there is no clear way to see how to enable\n                  the message. Clicking on the icon would be the first presumption of doing that but that functionality\n                  was not there. The user would have to open the message which would display ALL options for any message\n                  to be created. This would lead to the next problem: too many options that did not have anything to do\n                  with simple messages. After looking all of the options then the user could enable the message at the\n                  bottom of the template.\n                </p>\n                <p>Creating a new message would display the same template as above but none of the fields would be filled\n                  in.

However, the time savings is very small when\n                  they have to go in and try to set up the messaging in the system above.

I also suggested a change\n                  in icon to something users are more used to seeing when it comes to messaging.\n                </p>\n                <p>I also opted to move creating a new message to the top of the page rather than the bottom. This would allow\n                  users to easily access the ability to create a new message. With that I suggested adding in templates rather than\n                  making users set up messages by themselves. This would help new users who didn't know what type of messages they\n                  needed as well as help veteran users add new messages more quickly. Finally, I explored and suggested removing any\n                  fields from templates that were not realative to their respective template. This would limit the scrolling\n                  of the page when the message was being worked on as well as eliminate confusion on what fields should be filled\n                  in over other fields.\n                </p>\n              </div>\n            </div>\n          </div>\n\n          <div id='ss-m-final' class=\"opac-0\" :class=\"{ 'animated fadeInUp': scrollY > 2715 || isApplied('ss-m-final') }\">\n\n            <h3><strong>What I Would Change</strong></h3>\n            <p>\n            <ul>\n              <li>\n                Change the add a template button. In the exploration wireframes it does represent itself as a dropdown\n                but would possibly be better as just a button. The idea would then be to take the user through a\n                step by step process of creating a new message. This would need to be tested heavily first to see if\n                a step by step process would be more confusing or troublesome to users.\n              </li>\n              <li>Offer prefilled templates. This would allow even more time savings for users. However, would adding\n                prefilled templates be a different dropdown or button than the one in the wireframes? An arguement\n                can also be made to just have the templates already prefilled and allow users to just change them.\n              </li>\n              <li>Testing.

It allows the user to pan around the\n              map and zoom in and zoom out. My original idea was to ax that as I was going to have other elements that could be positioned\n              around the page and I didn’t want the user to feel like everything was overlapping too much. However, table top players like\n              their large maps. So I axed my own idea and changed it so that user could resize their map, as long as it wasn’t too small,\n              and allow them to collapse and expand other widgets to give them optimal viewing space.\n            </p>\n            <p>Next important feedback: “The bar at the top of the game board screen isn’t clear that it means a new window will be opened\n              up. In that aspect, opening a new window would be the same as putting a bar up top that allows the user to change their\n              settings. By the way, why can’t I change my game board settings here?”\n            </p>\n            <p>This was a very valid point. I had only given the user the option to change their game settings outside of the game board.\n              That makes no sense! Each game would have their own settings based on the user’s preference for that game’s play style. Maybe\n              in one game the user isn’t using video at all and as such wouldn’t even need the video widget anymore. This also brought to\n              light, in pairing with the previous feedback, that the Data Library widget was going to suffer if left on the game board.\n              There was going to be too much information to be displayed in a widget. So I changed the idea of new window, gave the user a\n              dropdown bar that allows them to open a new window with the data library, change their settings and exit the game board.\n              Exiting the game board would return the user to their Games page instead of closing the application completely.\n            </p>\n          </div>\n\n          <div id='v-6' class=\"opac-0\" :class=\"{ 'animated fadeInUp': scrollY > 5362 || isApplied('v-6') }\">\n            <h3><strong>Invision Prototype</strong></h3>\n            <a href=\"https://projects.invisionapp.com/share/4GGQHVG2BK7#/screens/289856614_Home_Page\" target=\"_blank\">\n            <img src=\"/img/invisionapp.png\" id=\"invision\" />\n            </a>\n            <h3><strong>Technical Demo</strong></h3>\n            <p>The Game Board page of Venture.ng features widgets that can be moved, resized, collpased and expanded so I wanted to show\n              just exactly how that would work.

Game Masters run the game and create the world and as such they need to have access to different assets than\n                players do.\n              </li>\n              <li>Character Sheet Onboarding.Character sheets are hard and most players aren’t good at traversing a ruleset’s player guides. A guided Character\n                Sheet creation would chop off some time when creating a character.\n              </li>\n              <li>Ruleset Based Data Library. Players are bad at even obtaining player guide books. Not all information for each ruleset is avaliable online either. A centralized Data Library would give players without access to the books, the information they need.</li>\n              <li>Friends. Not everyone has friends or habitually checks the looking for group reddit and these people also need a way to\n                play tabletop (even with strangers). The idea would be to create a board within the website for GM’s and Players to\n                recruit each other for games\n              </li>\n            </ul>\n            </p>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</template>\n<script>\n  import TrackScroll from '@/mixins/TrackScroll.vue'\n  import ScrollToNav from \"@/mixins/ScrollToNav.vue\"\n  export default {\n      name: \"venture\",\n      mixins: [\n          ScrollToNav,\n          TrackScroll\n      ],\n      methods: {\n      isApplied(id) {\n          const el = document.getElementById(id)\n          if (!el) return;\n          if (el.classList.contains('animated')) {\n              return true;\n          }\n      }\n  }\n  }\n</script>\n\n<style lang=\"scss\">\n    #streetsmarts {\n\n        .opac-0 {\n            opacity: 0;\n\n            &.animated {\n                opacity: 1;\n                transition: opacity .5s;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n</style>\n\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// src/views/venture/index.vue","var render = function () {var _vm=this;var _h=_vm.$createElement;var _c=_vm._self._c||_h;return _c('div',{attrs:{\"id\":\"venture\"}},[_c('div',{staticClass:\"container-fluid\"},[_c('div',{staticClass:\"row\"},[_c('div',{staticClass:\"col-md-6 col-md-offset-3 align-left\"},[_vm._m(0),_c('div',{staticClass:\"opac-0\",class:{ 'animated fadeInUp': _vm.scrollY > 495 || _vm.isApplied('v-head') },attrs:{\"id\":\"v-head\"}},[_vm._m(1),_vm._m(2),_c('p',[_vm._v(\"The idea was to create an application for people interested in tabletop to be able to play with friends or family that are\\n            in different locations.

These disclosures ranged from if an employee worked another job at another company and what that work entailed to what an employee donated to a political campaign.</p>\n                <p>All disclosures were sent to the employee's manager for a preliminary approval and then sent further to the compliance admin office. The job of the admins was to see who the employee was and wether their disclosure was okay or if they needed to cease doing whatever it was that was in the disclosure. The entire process was originally completed with paper forms. The compliance website was created first to get rid of the forms and then second to make the process easier for both the employees and the admins.</p>\n                <p>For this project, I started with the political contribution flow. Out of all of the disclosures, it was the most complicated workflow for the admins. It was also the disclosure that was the most \"done\". The definition of done was that it was live for both employees and admins but only checked off the barest minimum of requirements.</p>\n              </div>\n            </div>\n          </div>\n\n          <div id='fi-r-in-begin' class=\"opac-0\" :class=\"{ 'animated fadeInUp': scrollY > 1355 || isApplied('fi-r-in-begin') }\">\n            <div class=\"row\">\n              <div class='col-md-5'>\n                <h3><strong>In the Beginning...</strong></h3>\n                <br />\n                <br />\n                <p>However, only the first part was done well. The employee side was great and everyone was happy they didn't have to try to fill out forms and keep track of them as they moved through the system.</p>\n                <p>Admins were not feeling the same happiness. Digitizing forms for employees was the easiest step. Displaying it an organized fashion for admins was not. The forms, even when digitized, could potentially contain up hundreds of input points that an admin had to review. Depending on the disclosure, the admin then had to complete other steps like complete a checklist or check an employee's previous disclosures.</p>\n                <p>The main problem with making this process easier was because compliance is such a robust topic, legal teams and business teams were driving what the design should look like. Up until the point that I joined the team there was little to no user testing done. With that said, the business team was hearing the complaints from the admins and it was decided that we needed to change the current design. However, it was also decided that the development team wanted to avoid a redesign as much as possible.</p>\n\n              </div>\n              <div class='col-md-7'>\n                <img class=\"image-size\" src=\"/img/FidelityStuff/Redesign/DNA_PCA_New_1stPL_P2P_EX.png\" />\n              </div>\n            </div>\n          </div>\n          <div id='fi-r-rehash' class=\"opac-0\" :class=\"{ 'animated fadeInUp': scrollY > 2015 || isApplied('fi-r-rehash') }\">\n            <div class=\"row\">\n              <div class='col-md-7'>\n                <img class=\"image-size\" src=\"/img/FidelityStuff/Redesign/ReHash1.png\" />\n                <img class=\"image-size\" src=\"/img/FidelityStuff/Redesign/ReHash2.png\" />\n              </div>\n              <div class='col-md-5'>\n                <h3><strong>The Rehash Route</strong></h3>\n                <br />\n                <br />\n                <p>So the first step was a rehash of the current design. Could the information be laid out in a way in the current design that it would help the admins out better? I also had other requirements from the business to follow as well: limit page scrolling and don't cut out any data points.</p>\n                <p>The rehashed designs were shown to the admin users and they were not happy. They had been hoping for a completely new design. All the rehash did was move data points around. Sure, the organization was better but the workflow the admins had to go through was still a mess and no easier than if they were doing it with the previous design.</p>\n              </div>\n            </div>\n\n          </div>\n          <div id='fi-r-section-1' class=\"opac-0\" :class=\"{ 'animated fadeInUp': scrollY > 2977 || isApplied('fi-r-section-1') }\">\n\n            <div class=\"row\">\n              <div class='col-md-5'>\n                <h3><strong>Redesign Round 1</strong></h3>\n                <p>With the first round of designs I tried a couple different things:\n                <ul>\n                  <li>Keep some elements the same as they were in the previous design but make them more organized. Similar to the rehash but I put things that weren't previously together in the same spots if they seemed to be part of the same information block.</li>\n                  <li>Use scrolling but use it in a way that it didn't seem tedious to scroll. This is what brought about the jump links in the first design.</li>\n                  <li>Moving unimportant information to a side panel. This would hopefully clean up much needed space for other more important components.</li>\n                  <li>Unhiding steps of the userflow that were previous only accessable behind links or would open up in other windows.

A search for the table was introduced so that any accounts outside of the search parameters would not be shown on the table. Another way to allow the user to check over statuses quickly was allowing the ability to click on the headers and change the ordering of the table. This way, say for example, the user wanted to only have their not completed accounts at the top, they could click the header and change the ordering.</p>\n                <p>The only other two core requirements were the ability to comment on a line item and the ability to edit a line item in line. A lot of 17a6 was manual work and the users had to correct line items if they did not match up to the statements that were provided.

It still needed to be decided if the user could edit the whole line item or just part of it.</p>\n                <p>Users prefered the third design.
