          <p class="align-left">I am a Columbus, Ohio native gone full Bostonian. I attended and graduated from Columbus 
          College of Art and Design with a Bachelors of Fine Arts in Animation. To be more exact, I graduated exclusively wanting to be a 2D Animator. 
          At the time of graduating the world was moving away from 2D and more towards 3D Animation (this was before shows like Super Jail 
          became popular and Flash animations made a comeback). So, as not to be left behind or without options I met my signifigant other, 
          moved to Western Massachusetts, and started a career in Customer Service! I still made flash animations in my free time but I had more 
          or less told my creative background to take a back seat because we had to be an adult.</p>
          
          <p class="align-left">After two years, we left our Western Massachusetts life and moved to Boston because my signifigant other had found a job in the city. 
          My career then shifted to Customer Success and that’s where I have been ever since. However, after a recent layoff I have decided to 
          get back to my more creative roots. In my time after moving to MA, I taught myself HTML, CSS and some pretty basic Javascript. It was 
          time, I decided, to try to become a UX Designer/Developer. I have since completed General Assembly’s UX Design 5 week course and 
          work on both personal projects and launched applications.</p>
          
          <p class="align-left">My goal is to take the experiences I have gained while being a Customer Success Manager and help them make me a better 
          UX Designer/Developer. Outside of work, I play video games, take bike rides when the Nor’Easters decide to take a break, hike, work 
          on for fun animations, and play with my two cats.</p>
