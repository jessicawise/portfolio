          <p class="align-left">I am a Columbus, Ohio native gone full Bostonian. I attended and graduated from Columbus 
          College of Art and Design with a Bachelors of Fine Arts in 2D Animation. I am a User Experience Designer who draws on
          my experiences in animation and various positions across the Customer Service and Customer Success spectrum. My goal
          is to ensure that whatever product or project I work on is user oriented and the best thing that it can be.</p>
          
          <p class="align-left">I've had the privilege to work with many different teams in my various positions and I enjoy
            being part of the discussion that happen in those teams. I also try to make sure that I learn from those teams to make
            my designs better. At the same time I try to urge those teams towards user centric thinking and pushing the envelope so
            they too can help the product or project be the best it can be.
          </p>
          
          <p class="align-left">Outside of work, I play video games, take bike rides when the Nor’Easters decide to take a break, hike, work 
          on for fun animations, and play with my two cats.</p>
